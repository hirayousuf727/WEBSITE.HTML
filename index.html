    <p>HTML<B> (HyperText Markup Language)</B> is a markup language used to structure and organize the content on a web page. It uses various tags to define the different elements on a page, such as headings, paragraphs, and links.</p>
    HTML language is  used for creating webpages which is the fundamental building block of the Web.

    One thing to remember about HTML is that it is a markup language with no programming constructs. Instead, the language provides us with a structure to build web pages.
    
    Using HTML, we can define web page elements such as paragraphs, headings, links, and images. Our HTML tutorials will teach you everything you need to know about HTML5 (modern HTML) step-by-step.
           you can find 200 more example in html 
        there are two type 
        <ol type="i">
         <li>opening tag [<>]</li>
          <li>closing tag [</>]</li>
        </ol>
        An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.
        Start tag	Element content	End tag
some element like <b>br</b>they have no opening nad closing tag .
<br><b>Note</b> Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are called empty elements. Empty elements do not have an end tag!
<h2>heading</h2>
HTML headings are titles or subtitles that you want to display on a webpage.
<h3><b><u>example</u></b></h3>
<h1>heading 1</h1>
<h2>heading 2 </h2>
<h3>heading 3</h3>
<h4>heading 4 </h4>
<h5>heading 5 </h5>
<h6>heading 6</h6>
<h3>paragraph</h3>
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and is usually a block of text.
The HTML <p> element defines a paragraph.
A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.
<h3>linking</h3>
Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.
HTML links are hyperlinks.
You can click on a link and jump to another document.
When you move the mouse over a link, the mouse arrow will turn into a little hand.
<h3>HTML Links - Syntax</h3>
The HTML [a]  tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:
<A href="#TOP">TOP</A>

CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.
CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.
This tutorial will teach you CSS from basic to advanced.
This CSS tutorial contains hundreds of CSS examples.
<h3><b>what is css ?</b></h3>
<ul>
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
External stylesheets are stored in CSS files
</ul>
A CSS rule consists of a selector and a declaration block.
<h2>CSS Syntax</h2>
The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.
The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.
Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.
Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
<H1>CSS Selectors</H1>
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
<H2>CSS Backgrounds</H2>
The CSS background properties are used to add background effects for elements.
 You will learn about the following CSS background properties:
 css back ground have 6 type given under below ;
 <ul>
<li>background-color</li>
<li>background-image</li>
    <li>background-repeat</li>
        <li>background-attachment</li>
            <li>background-position</li>
                <li>background (shorthand property)</li>
 </ul>
 <h2>CSS background-color</h2>
 The background-color property specifies the background color of an element.
 <h2>CSS background-image</h2>
The background-image property specifies an image to use as the background of an element.
By default, the image is repeated so it covers the entire element.
<H2>CSS background-repeat</H2>
 the background-image property repeats an image both horizontally and vertically.
Some images should be repeated only horizontally or vertically, or they will look strange
<h2>CSS background-attachment</h2>
    The background-attachment property specifies whether the background image should scroll or be fixed (will not scroll with the rest of the page):
    <h2>CSS background - Shorthand property</h2>
        To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property. This is called a shorthand property.
        <h2>css border </h2>
        The CSS border properties allow you to specify the style, width, and color of an element's border.
      <h1>css margin </h1>        
        Margins are used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.
        <h1>CSS HEIGHT AND WEIDTH </h1>
        The CSS height and width properties are used to set the height and width of an element.
The CSS max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.
<H1>With CSS, links can be styled in many different ways.
<h1> Lists and CSS List Properties</H1>
In HTML, there are two main types of lists:
unordered lists (<ul>) - the list items are marked with bullets
ordered lists (<ol>) - the list items are marked with numbers or letters
    <H1>LINKS</H1>
    With CSS, links can be styled in many different ways.
    <OL>
        <LI>TEXT LINK</LI>
        <LI>LINK BUTTON</LI>
        </OL>
    <A href="#TOP">top</A>
<h1 id="java">JAVA SCRIPT </h1>

JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.
JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
JavaScript is easy to learn.
This tutorial will teach you JavaScript from basic to advance
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and  </script>script tags.
<h2>JavaScript Statements</h2>
JavaScript statements are composed of:
Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
This statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":
<h2>syntax</h2>
avaScript syntax is the set of rules, how JavaScript programs are constructed:

// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;
JavaScript Values
The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
Fixed values
Variable values
Fixed values are called Literals.
Variable values are called Variables.
JavaScript Literals
The two most important syntax rules for fixed values are:
1. Numbers are written with or without decimals:
10.50
1001
2. Strings are text, written within double or single quotes:
"John Doe"
'John Doe'
<h2>JavaScript Comments</h2>
JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.
JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.
Single Line Comments
Single line comments start with //.
Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).
This example uses a single-line comment before each code line:
<b>example</b>
// Change heading:
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
// Change paragraph:
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
This example uses a single line comment at the end of each line to explain the code:
<b>examples</b> x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
    let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2
    <b>Multi-line Comments</b>
    Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.
    Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript.
    This example uses a multi-line comment (a comment block) to explain the code:    
    Example
    /*
    The code below will change
    the heading with id = "myH"
    and the paragraph with id = "myP"
    in my web page:
    */
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";
document.getElementById("myP").innerHTML = "My first paragraph.";
<h2>java script veriable </h2>
Variables are Containers for Storing Data
JavaScript Variables can be declared in 4 ways:
Automatically
Using var
Using let
Using const
In this first example, x, y, and z are undeclared variables.
They are automatically declared when first used:
Example
x = 5;
y = 6;
z = x + y;
Note
It is considered good programming practice to always declare variables before use.

From the examples you can guess:

x stores the value 5
y stores the value 6
z stores the value 11
Example using var
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
<h2>java script let</h2>
The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015)
Variables declared with let have Block Scope
Variables declared with let must be Declared before use
Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope
<h2>Block Scope</h2>
Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript did not have Block Scope.
JavaScript had Global Scope and Function Scope.
ES6 introduced the two new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
These two keywords provided Block Scope in JavaScript:
Example
Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
{
  let x = 2;
}
// x can NOT be used here
Global Scope
Variables declared with the var always have Global Scope.
Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope:
Example
Variables declared with varinside a { } block can be accessed from outside the block:
{
  var x = 2;
}
// x CAN be used here
